This Module 3 Lab is a contiuation from the Module 2 Lab.
For this lab, we practiced joins, as well as continuing to build onto other skills learned in the previous weeks.
In brief this is what was performed:
  - Rename a table in the database to Department
  - Insert values into the Department table
  - Perform an INNER JOIN of the Employee and Department tables for each Department (4)
  - Insert 10 new employees into the Employee table
  - Perform a JOIN to verify records
      - I tried to do a FULL JOIN, but mySQL doesn't support a FULL JOIN, so I ended up doing 4 more INNER JOINs.
      - I was able to do a SELECT command with the columns I needed from the two tables in a different terminal (screenshot labeled '_SeparateTerminal')
      - However, that command did not work in my main terminal, hence why I did the 4 INNER JOINs
  - Created a CSV for departments 2 and 3
  - Printed the text from the CSV
